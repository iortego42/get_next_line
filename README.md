### Read everything you want :)

This little projects reads a file with a predefined buffer of 32 (if you want to change that value you can compile wiht -D BUFFER\_SIZE=<size> or change the value in the .h file).

It works charging the BUFFER\_SIZE value on a static array and then process that information before charging again.

On the folder LOR there is a test which reads the Lord Of the Rings.
